## üîó Introduction

This is a starter template for building React applications with [Ant Design 5.0](https://ant.design/), designed to work seamlessly within the [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) environment.



## üõ†Ô∏è Installation & Setup

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/HyaCiovo/AntD5-Admin.git
   cd AntD5-Admin
   ```

   

2. **Install Dependencies**

   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

   This will install all the required dependencies listed in the package.json file.

## üì¶ Dependencies

The project relies on several key packages to function as intended. Below is a list of the core dependencies:

| name              | version | description                                                  |
| :---------------- | :------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| @ant-design/icons | 5.3.7   | provides a rich set of icons for use with Ant Design components. |
| ahooks            | 3.8.0   | a collection of custom hooks for React to simplify state management and side effects. |
| antd              | 5.19.0  | a popular UI library based on Ant Design specifications.     |

| zustand           | 4.5.4   | a small, fast, and scalable state management library.        |

These dependencies are essential for the application's functionality and are included in the production build.



## üîß Development Dependencies

Development dependencies are crucial for the development process but are not needed for the application to run in production. Here are the development dependencies:

| name                                                        | description                                                  |

| @typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin, @typescript-eslint/parser | ESLint plugins for TypeScript to enforce coding standards.   |
| @vitejs/plugin-react-swc                                    | Vite plugin for React using SWC for Fast Refresh.            |
| autoprefixer                                                | For automatically adding vendor prefixes to CSS properties.  |

| eslint-plugin-react-hooks, eslint-plugin-react-refresh      | ESLint plugins for React Hooks and Vite's React refresh.     |
| less                                                        | Preprocessor for CSS to write cleaner and more maintainable stylesheets. |
| postcss                                                     | A tool for transforming styles with JS plugins.              |

| vite-plugin-compression                                     | Vite plugin for compressing assets during the build process. |

These tools are used for development purposes such as linting, styling, and optimizing the codebase.



## üöÄ Running Locally

```bash
pnpm run dev
```

This command will start the development server, and you can access your application at http://localhost:3100 (or another port specified in your configuration).



## üì¶ Building for Production

When you're ready to deploy your application, you'll need to build it for production:

```bash
pnpm run build
```

This command will generate the optimized production-ready files in the dist directory (or another location defined in your build scripts).

After running the build command, you can serve the static files from the dist directory using a web server of your choice.
